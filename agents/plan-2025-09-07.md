# The Resistance - Browser FPS Game Plan

## Game Concept
A first-person shooter set in post-war alternative history Britain where Nazi Germany won. Players can join as either Resistance fighters or Nazi forces in an open-world multiplayer environment.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend/Client
- **Three.js** or **React Three Fiber (R3F)** - 3D rendering and game engine
  - Three.js for pure performance or R3F for React integration
  - Recommend Three.js for better FPS performance
- **Cannon.js** or **Rapier** - Physics engine for collision detection and projectile physics
- **WebRTC** or **WebSockets** - Real-time multiplayer communication
- **Vite** - Fast development server and build tool
- **TypeScript** - Type safety for complex game logic

### Backend/Multiplayer
- **Node.js** with **Socket.io** - Real-time multiplayer server
- **WebRTC** for peer-to-peer connections (reduce server load)
- **Redis** - Session management and game state
- **Docker** - Containerized deployment

### Hosting & Infrastructure
- **Vercel/Netlify** - Static frontend hosting
- **Railway/Fly.io** - Backend server hosting
- **Cloudflare** - CDN for assets and DDoS protection

## Architecture Overview

### Client-Server Hybrid Model
1. **Authoritative Server** - Validates all game actions, prevents cheating
2. **Client Prediction** - Smooth movement and instant feedback
3. **Server Reconciliation** - Corrects client predictions when needed
4. **Lag Compensation** - Rollback netcode for hit registration

### Game World Structure
- **Chunked World Loading** - Load areas as players move through them
- **Level of Detail (LOD)** - Reduce polygon count for distant objects
- **Instanced Rendering** - Efficient rendering of repeated objects (buildings, trees)

## Core Systems

### 1. Player System
- **Character Controller** - FPS movement, jumping, crouching
- **Health & Status** - HP, stamina, equipment
- **Inventory** - Weapons, ammo, items
- **Team Assignment** - Resistance vs Nazi forces

### 2. Combat System
- **Weapon Mechanics** - Different weapon types, recoil patterns
- **Projectile Physics** - Realistic bullet trajectories
- **Hit Detection** - Raycasting for instant-hit weapons
- **Damage System** - Armor, headshots, body parts

### 3. World System
- **Procedural Buildings** - Generate London-like destroyed cityscape
- **Cover System** - Destructible and non-destructible cover
- **Spawn Points** - Dynamic spawn locations based on team control
- **Objectives** - Capture points, supply drops, intel gathering

### 4. AI System (For Solo Players)
- **Bot Players** - AI opponents when low player count
- **NPC Civilians** - Background atmosphere
- **Dynamic Events** - Air raids, supply drops, reinforcements

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Basic Three.js scene with FPS camera
- [ ] Simple player movement and mouse look
- [ ] Basic terrain generation
- [ ] WebSocket connection setup

### Phase 2: Combat Mechanics
- [ ] Weapon system implementation
- [ ] Shooting mechanics and projectiles
- [ ] Hit detection and damage
- [ ] Basic UI (health, ammo, crosshair)
- [ ] Sound effects integration

### Phase 3: Multiplayer Foundation
- [ ] Server architecture setup
- [ ] Player synchronization
- [ ] Client-side prediction
- [ ] Basic anti-cheat measures
- [ ] Team assignment system

### Phase 4: World Building
- [ ] Level design tools
- [ ] Asset pipeline for 3D models
- [ ] Lighting and atmosphere
- [ ] Cover system implementation
- [ ] Spawn point system

### Phase 5: Game Mechanics
- [ ] Objective system
- [ ] Score tracking
- [ ] Respawn mechanics
- [ ] Equipment/loadout system
- [ ] Basic AI opponents

### Phase 6: Polish & Launch
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Mobile compatibility
- [ ] User interface polish
- [ ] Testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Deployment setup

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- **Frustum Culling** - Only render objects in view
- **Occlusion Culling** - Hide objects behind walls
- **Texture Atlasing** - Reduce draw calls
- **Audio Spatial Processing** - 3D positional audio
- **Network Optimization** - Delta compression, priority updates

### Security Measures
- **Server Authority** - All critical game state on server
- **Input Validation** - Sanitize all client inputs
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevent spam and DDoS
- **Encrypted Communications** - Secure WebSocket connections

### Browser Compatibility
- **WebGL 2.0** - Modern 3D graphics support
- **WebAssembly** - Performance-critical calculations
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Graceful degradation for older browsers
- **Mobile Responsive** - Touch controls for mobile devices

## Asset Requirements

### 3D Models
- Character models (Resistance fighters, Nazi soldiers)
- Weapon models (rifles, pistols, grenades)
- Environment assets (buildings, vehicles, props)
- Terrain textures and materials

### Audio
- Weapon sound effects
- Ambient environment sounds
- Voice acting for teams
- Background music

### UI/UX
- Main menu design
- In-game HUD elements
- Settings and configuration screens
- Loading screens and transitions

## Next Steps
1. Set up the development environment with Vite + Three.js
2. Create basic FPS camera and movement controls
3. Implement simple multiplayer connection
4. Build a minimal viable prototype for testing

This plan provides a solid foundation for building a browser-based FPS game while keeping scope manageable and focusing on core gameplay mechanics first.
